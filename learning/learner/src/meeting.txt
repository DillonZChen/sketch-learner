Q1. How to use these boolean features

E.g. f = n - n0 > 0 (inc n)

{-f, ...} -> {f, ...} - last transition of policy that achieves subgoal
{-f, ...} -> {...} - some transition of policy, can be satisfied in other subproblems as well

Observation: on the way to the subgoal, features can change arbitrarily.
Not so clear if seed features can capture that
specific policy is currently executed to reach subgoal from s
instead of ending up in a cycle...

Q2. Subgoal tuples are a general subgoal description.
Like in our general high-level goal description of a domain.
However, the general subgoal description can be more general, i.e.,
atoms of all different kinds of domain predicates can occur.

Q3. With Q2 leads to:
Learn several policies for a single policy rule
where the features that relate to seed state or subgoal
ensure that we do not end in a cycle.
